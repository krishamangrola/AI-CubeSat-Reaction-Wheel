# AI-CubeSat-Reaction-Wheel
This project simulates and optimizes a reaction wheel assembly for a CubeSat to enable attitude control using AI algorithms and Python-based simulation.

## 🚀 Objective
- Simulate torque and response time of a CubeSat reaction wheel system
- Use a PID controller to maintain satellite orientation
- Optimize design parameters (e.g. mass, radius, material) using AI

## 📁 Structure
- `/CAD/`: TinkerCAD export of wheel design
- `/simulation/`: Python models for dynamics, PID, and optimization
- `/reports/`: Documentation and presentation files

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, DEAP)
- TinkerCAD
- VS Code
- GitHub

## 📈 Outcome
- A full CubeSat reaction wheel simulation with performance graphs
- AI-optimized configuration balancing torque vs mass/power
